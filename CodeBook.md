#DATA DICTIONARY FOR tidydata

###August 2016

###Can be read with read.table

##Transformations on source data (Refer to README.md for more details)
* Source data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Training data merged X_train.txt, y_train.txt, Subject_train.txt
* Test data merged X_test.txt, y_test.txt, Subject_test.txt
* training and test data merged (appended rows)
* Column headings from the features.txt applied to merged data
* All column heading with mean() and std() extracted - these correspond to 33 variables as defined in the readme.txt
* Converted subjectid to a 1-6 level factor and applied Activity Labels as factor leves
* Updated column named from mean to MEAN, std to STDEV, gyro to Gyroscope, Acc to acceleration, Mag to Magnitude
* changed column names with BodyBody to Body and removed all dots from column names
* Aggregated data with ACtivity and SubjectID group by and mean of all variables are the summary
* tidydata crated and all column names updated to prefix avg to show that they are grouped means
* tidydata ordered on Activity and Subjectid
